> Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.  
- *Arnold Schwarzenegger*

> For me life is about continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to group, to achieve, to conquer.  
- *Arnold Schwarzenegger*

> Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.  
- *Muhammad Ali*
