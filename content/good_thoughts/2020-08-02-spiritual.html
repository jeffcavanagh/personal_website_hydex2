<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more practical than finding God,<br />
than falling in Love ina quite absolute, final way.<br />
What you are in love with,<br />
what seizes your imagination, will affect everything.<br />
It will decide<br />
what will get you out of bed in the morning,<br />
what you do with your evenings,<br />
how you spend your weekends,<br />
what you read, whom you know,<br />
what breaks your heart,<br />
and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.<br />
Fall in love, stay in love,<br />
and it will decide everything.<br />
- <em>Pedro Arrupe, S.J.</em></p>
