<h4>Nothing Gold Can Stay</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s first green is gold,<br />
Her hardest hue to hold,<br />
Her early leaf’s a flower;<br />
But only so an hour.<br />
Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br />
So Eden sank to grief,<br />
So dawn goes down to day.<br />
Nothing gold can stay.<br />
- <em>Robert Frost</em></p>

<h4>The Road Not Taken</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
And sorry I could not travel both,<br />
And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
And looked down one as far as I could<br />
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br />
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
Because it was grassy and wanted wear:<br />
Though as for that the passing there<br />
Had worn them really both the same,<br />
And both that morning equally lay<br />
In leaves no step had trodden black<br />
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br />
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
Two roads diverged in a narrow wood, and I -<br />
I took the one less traveled by,<br />
And that has made all the difference.<br />
- <em>Robert Frost</em></p>
