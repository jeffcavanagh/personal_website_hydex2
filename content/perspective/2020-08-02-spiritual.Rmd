> Nothing is more practical than finding God,  
than falling in Love in a quite absolute, final way.  
What you are in love with,  
what seizes your imagination, will affect everything.  
It will decide  
what will get you out of bed in the morning,  
what you do with your evenings,  
how you spend your weekends,  
what you read, whom you know,  
what breaks your heart,  
and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.  
Fall in love, stay in love,  
and it will decide everything.  
- *Pedro Arrupe, S.J.*
