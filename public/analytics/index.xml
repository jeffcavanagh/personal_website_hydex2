      <description>Text data cannot be processed identically to numerical or categorical data. Is there a way then to analyze text data insight from it??
Of course! All it takes is an adapted approach and a little more work upfront.
Quite a bit of potential data is unstructured and textual in nature, and does not operate by the same rules as numerical or categorical data. That does not mean there is not value to this format of data though.</description>

      <description>This post will cover some primary methods of regression analysis and how to apply them in R. It will also serve as a warmup for the posts that explore more advanced machine learning and AI methods.
Setup For a data set to analyze, we will look at statistics concerning the history of my favorite sports team, The Detroit Lions. This data comes from Pro Football Reference.
