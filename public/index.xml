      <description>Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
- Arnold Schwarzenegger
  For me life is about continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to group, to achieve, to conquer.
- Arnold Schwarzenegger
  Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given than to explore the power they have to change it.</description>

      <description>Nothing Gold Can Stay  Nature’s first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold,
Her early leaf’s a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf.
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day.
Nothing gold can stay.
- Robert Frost
  The Road Not Taken  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both,</description>

      <description>stringr The Data Cleaning Text Data Breaking Down Text Data Word Analysis   Text data cannot be processed identically to numerical or categorical data. Is there a way then to analyze text data and obtain insight from it??
Of course! All it takes is an adapted approach and a little more work upfront.
Quite a bit of potential data is unstructured and textual in nature.To extract the underlying value of this category of data, different techniques are required.</description>

      <description>Just Mercy  We are all broken by something. We have all hurt someone and have been hurt. We all share the condition of brokenness even if our brokenness is not equivalent…
…Thomas Merton said: We are bodies of broken bones. I guess I’d always known but never fully considered that being broken is what makes us human. We all have our reasons. Sometimes we’re fractured by the choices we make; sometimes we’re shattered by things we would never have chosen.</description>

      <description>Setup  CSS Tool Data  rvest Selenium   Unfortunately, not all data is contained within neat data frames. There is a virtually unlimited amount of data contained within web pages, but extracting and manipulated that information into a usable and familiar format is a major obstacle. This post will serve as an introduction on how to extract data from web pages using R and Python with the packages rvest and Selenium.</description>

      <description>Nothing is more practical than finding God,
than falling in Love in a quite absolute, final way.
What you are in love with,
what seizes your imagination, will affect everything.
It will decide
what will get you out of bed in the morning,
what you do with your evenings,
how you spend your weekends,
what you read, whom you know,
what breaks your heart,
and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.</description>
