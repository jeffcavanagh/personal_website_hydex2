      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

  Rocky Balboa  The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place, and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life.</description>

      <description>Nothing is more practical than finding God,
than falling in Love ina quite absolute, final way.
What you are in love with,
what seizes your imagination, will affect everything.
It will decide
what will get you out of bed in the morning,
what you do with your evenings,
how you spend your weekends,
what you read, whom you know,
what breaks your heart,
and what amazes you with joy and gratitude.</description>

      <description>For my graduate project I created an optimization that analyses the cost of electricity world wide and determines how expensive the indirect costs of fossil fuel consumption need to be in order for the installation of renewable electricity sources to be a more financially viable option for the future.

      <description>Setup trails=read.csv(&amp;quot;AllTrailsdata_nationalpark.csv&amp;quot;,header=T) attach(trails) dim(trails) ## [1] 3313 18 This data set gives information on trails in the National Parks Service. The data is publically available on Kaggle.com.
Each row is a different trail. The columns describing each trail are:
 trail_id name area_name city_name state_name country_name _geoloc (coordinates) popularity (scaled value) length (km) elevation_gain difficulty_rating (1:5) route_type (out and back, loop, point to point) visitor_usage (1:4) avg_rating (1:5) num_reviews features (dogs-no, forest, views, lake, wild-flowers, etc…) activities (birding, hiking, nature-trips, etc…) units (i,m)  Average rating was chosen as the dependent variable.</description>

      <description>This was a final project I completed for my Regression and Time Series Analysis Course. I took data from the 2017 NFL season and used it to see what metrics were significant in predicting the number of wins a team would achieve.

      <description>This is a Java reference implementation of dynamic event-driven actors runtime aiming at providing adequate abstraction levels and mechanisms for modelling and developing (distributed) event-based systems. DERA leverages the intrinsic loose coupling of event-driven communication styles to support various kinds of run-time evolution and adaptation (i.e., enabling run-time flexibility) while minimizing the non-deterministic nature of traditional event-based applications (i.e., supporting formal analysis).</description>

      <description>Hyde-hyde is a responsive Hugo theme inspired by @spf13&amp;rsquo;s Hyde and its variant Nate Finch&amp;rsquo;s blog. It was heavily restructured with modularised page layouts for easier maintenance and modification. Hyde-hyde offers awesome features such as nice colour tone, code highlighting, Font-Awesome 5&amp;rsquo;s sidebar icons), a cool portfolio page, more choices for commenting (e.g. GraphComment, Disqus).</description>

      <description>LaraMod is another modularisation effort to systematically organising a Laravel based project. The idea stems from my struggle to structure a Laravel-based project so that I can work effectively on individual modules whilst keeping Laravel codebase intact as much as possible and also keeping the project&amp;rsquo;s codebase separate from Laravel.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
