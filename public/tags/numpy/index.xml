      <description>Indirect Costs of the Various Energy Sources Coast Coefficients by Fuel Source (Production, Import, Export, Consumption) Packages Used to Build Model Upper Limit on Fuel Sources Defining Constraints Energy Production Capacity by Nation Defining the Objective Function Putting the Constraints Together Solving the Problem   For my graduate project I created an optimization model that analyzes the cost of electricity world wide and determines how expensive the indirect costs of fossil fuel consumption need to be in order for the installation of renewable electricity sources to be a more financially viable alternative.</description>
