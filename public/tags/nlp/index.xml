      <description>Data is only numerical or categorial right?? 
Wrong. Not all data these days is numerical and easy to work with established mathetimatical techniques. Quite a bit of potential data is unstructured and textual in nature, which does not operate by the same rules as numerical data. However, even though it is formatted differently, there are still underlying patterns and ways to work to draw insight from this subset of data.</description>
