      <description>The following was my final project for a Predictive Analytics course. It analyzed data on hiking trails throughout the US and created and compared models predicting whether or not a given trail will be rated above 4.5 stars out of 5.
Setup trails=read.csv(&amp;quot;AllTrailsdata_nationalpark.csv&amp;quot;,header=T) attach(trails) dim(trails) ## [1] 3313 18 This data set gives information on trails in the National Parks Service. The data is publicly available on Kaggle.com.</description>

      <description>This was a final project I completed for my Regression and Time Series Analysis Course. I took data from the 2017 NFL season and used SPSS to determine what metrics were significant in predicting the number of wins a team would achieve.
Here is the write up of the project</description>
